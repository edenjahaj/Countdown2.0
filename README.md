# Countdown2.0
**COUNTDOWN: Survey Mode** is a horror “phone app” game where you enter your name and a **random countdown** begins and **keeps running even after you close it**. While the timer ticks, the app forces you through a creepy **survey** and hits you with **glitches, popups, loud scares, and a full-screen face jumpscare**. Made by:Eden Jahaj (12 yr old)
